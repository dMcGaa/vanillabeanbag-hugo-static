## Ingredients (main)
- 2 cups Almond Flour (240 g)
- 4 tsp Baking Powder (16 g)
- 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
    - (Note: This is __optional__. Apple cider vinegar helps to mask any eggy taste and gives a nice yeasty flavor)
- 1/3 cup Coconut Oil (also use olive oil OR melted butter)
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 6 large Egg Whites
    - (OR, substitute) Egg whites from cartons (215 g)
    - (OR, substitute) 38 g of egg white powder + 210 ml room temperature water

## Ingredients (meringue)
- 6 Egg Whites (room temperature)
- 1/2 tsp Cream of tartar (optional, helps to stabilize the meringue)

## Directions
1.  Preheat the oven at 350F or 180C.

    - almond flour
    - baking powder
    - salt
3.  Add to bowl, mix until thick, then set aside
    - apple cider vinegar (if using)
    - coconut oil
    - egg whites
4.  In a separate bowl, make the meringue
    - egg whites and beat with a mixer at high speed until stiff peaks (about 1 minute)
5.  Fold the meringue into the first bowl.
    - Add 1/3 first and fold gently to combine. 
    - If meringue NOT folded, it will rise poorly.
    - Add another 1/3 of the meringue and fold.
    - Add last 1/3 of meringue and fold.
6. Pour the mix into an 8 x 4.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pan lined with parchment paper.
7. Bake at the lowest rack for __50 minutes__ or until cooked.
8. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

> The bread is a little cake-like and crumbly but still firm. It is light and soft. You can eat it on its own, top with your favorite spread or make sandwiches. When toasted, the crust is crispy and the crumb is tender.
